Your AI assistant now supports voice interaction in both **English** and **Norwegian**!

## 🎤 Voice Input (Speech Recognition)

### How to Speak to the AI:

1. **Select Your Language**: Choose your preferred language from the language dropdown:
   - 🇬🇧 English
   - 🇳🇴 Norsk (Norwegian)

2. **Click the Microphone Button**: Click the 🎤 button next to your text input

3. **Start Speaking**: 
   - The button will turn red and show "🎙️ Listening..."
   - Speak clearly and naturally
   - The system will convert your speech to text automatically

4. **Send Your Message**: 
   - The recognized text will appear in the input field
   - Click the send button or press Enter to submit

### Requirements:
- **Modern Web Browser**: Chrome, Edge, Safari, or Firefox
- **Microphone Access**: Grant microphone permission when prompted
- **Internet Connection**: Speech recognition requires network access

## 🔊 Voice Output (Text-to-Speech)

The AI automatically reads its responses aloud in your selected language:

- **English**: Uses English voice
- **Norwegian**: Uses Norwegian (Bokmål) voice
- **Auto-Disabled**: Long responses (300+ characters) are shortened for natural speech

### Features:
- Responses are spoken automatically when received
- Click anywhere in the chat to stop the current speech
- You can continue typing while listening to the response

## 🌍 Language Settings

Switch between languages anytime:
- Language selection is **saved** in your browser
- Works across all chat sessions
- Speech recognition and text-to-speech both follow your language choice

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting

### "No speech detected"
- Check that your microphone is working
- Speak clearly and loud enough
- Make sure you're in a quiet environment
- Try again - sometimes it needs a moment to listen

### "Permission denied"
- Allow microphone access when the browser asks
- Check your browser settings
- Some firewalls may block microphone access

### Speech recognition not available
- Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
- Older browsers don't support Web Speech API
- Try a different browser if one doesn't work

### Speech sounds robotic or unclear
- This depends on your browser's built-in voice
- Different browsers have different voice quality
- Try adjusting your browser's voice settings

## 💡 Tips

- **Speak naturally**: The AI understands conversational speech
- **Pause between sentences**: This helps the system recognize sentence boundaries
- **Spell out complex words**: For technical terms, spell them if they're misrecognized
- **Use context**: Refer back to previous messages for better understanding
- **Adjust volume**: Make sure your speakers are at a comfortable volume

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Enter** - Send message
- **Esc** - Stop listening (if recording)

Enjoy talking to your AI assistant! 🚀
